Building From Source
Element is a modular webapp built with modern ES6 and uses a Node.js build system. Ensure you have the latest LTS version of Node.js installed.

Using yarn instead of npm is recommended. Please see the Yarn install guide if you do not have it already.

Install or update node.js so that your node is at least the current recommended LTS.
Install yarn if not present already.
Clone the repo: git clone https://github.com/vector-im/element-web.git.
Switch to the element-web directory: cd element-web.
Install the prerequisites: yarn install.
If you're using the develop branch, then it is recommended to set up a proper development environment (see Setting up a dev environment below)(1). Alternatively, you can use https://develop.element.io (2) - the continuous integration release of the develop branch.
Configure the app by copying config.sample.json to config.json and modifying it. See the configuration docs for details.(3)
yarn dist to build a tarball to deploy. Untaring this file will give a version-specific directory containing all the files that need to go on your web server.
